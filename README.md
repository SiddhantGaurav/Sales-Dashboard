# Sales-Dashboard
This dashboard will provide a bigger picture of the activity of each sales representative on the basis of region(country), brand, industry, sales and revenue generated by each representative.
Putting it all together on sales dashboard, will enable you to automate your data , make your data dynamic, interactive and focus on human-centric tasks, without the need for time-consuming manual calculations and repetitive exports. The main idea of this project is to cover and achieve seven objectives given below: -   Sales representative performance on the basis of sales value (sum &count of sales value) Sales representative performance on the basis of revenue Sales by country Sales by Brand Sales & Revenue by sales channels Sales by Industry Revenue by Brand 
 I have used four slicers[(i) sales representative: - In this we have seven sales representative alex, chang , glen, jenny, martha , mike and rose .on the basis of this we can judge their performance. (ii) year: - I have taken three years like 2013, 2014,2015 as per data, On the basis of this slicer you can compare the performance year wise. (iii) Month: - I have taken all twelve months into consideration as per data, On the basis of this slicer you can compare the performance of sale month wise. iv) Region(country): - I have taken seven countries into consideration as per data, On the basis of this slicer you can compare the performance of sale country wise.] to make my dashboard interactive and dynamic which will show the sales report and performance of sales representative year wise, month wise, by region, by brand, by industry, by revenue, by sales channels.
